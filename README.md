# Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) for beginners

## Introduction

This mini-course is designed to provide graduate students and researchers with an introduction to state-of-the-art, data-driven algorithms for the numerical approximation of a wide array of control and optimization problems governed by both linear and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Coverage includes a comprehensive exploration of the theory and convergence analysis of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Deep Operator Network (DeepONet). PINNs are applied to problems where initial and boundary conditions remain fixed, while DeepONet is used to approximate operators that map these conditions to optimal controls or designs. The numerical implementation of these algorithms using the [deepXDE](https://github.com/lululxvi/deepxde) libray in Python is considered as well. 

This repository contains all the material of the course, namely, notes, slides, videos, and Python scripts.
